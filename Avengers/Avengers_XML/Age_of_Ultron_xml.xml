[Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]</line><receiver>Iron Legion</receiver></dialogue><dialogue><speaker>Ultron</speaker><line>That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

[picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]</line><receiver>Clint Barton</receiver></dialogue><dialogue><speaker>Bruce Banner</speaker><line>All our work is gone.

That's why you let Stark take the scepter.</line><receiver>Wanda Maximoff</receiver></dialogue><dialogue><speaker>Wanda Maximoff</speaker><line>I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.</line><receiver>Ultron</receiver></dialogue><dialogue><speaker>Ultron</speaker><line>Everyone creates the thing they dread.
